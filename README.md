# Web-Scraper-Project

This program consists of two types of data scraped from two different websites.
The first of the two is data extracted from the movie review website IMDB which displays the user with the top 100 movies of all time.
The second is the website related to sports which shows the user with the points table of the current year's(2022-2023) Laliga football tournament.
The user can choose to view either of them from the main menu he is displayed at the start of the program.
Every time the user wants to view the data the code will scrape the live data from the website and the data is stored separately in the system.
All the data displayed is real and live from the website, be it the IMDb rating or the Laliga points table.
The visualization of these data follows the same method, whatever data is displayed in a graph is real and live from the website.
The user has multiple graphs to view from from both the websites, the user is given the option to choose from the menu where he/she is explained what each graph visualizes.
Thus making it simple for the user to better understand the data.
